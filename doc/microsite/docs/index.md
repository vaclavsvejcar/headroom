Would you like to have nice, up-to-date license/copyright headers in your source code files but hate to manage them manually? Then __Headroom__ is the right tool for you. Define your license header as [Mustache][web:mustache] template, put any template variables into [YAML][wiki:yaml] configuarion file, and you're ready to go!

__Headroom__ also offers much more than just adding, replacing or dropping license headers. It can also update years in copyrights for you, provides specialized support for some source code file types, and much more!

# Main Features
- __License Header Management__ - [Add, replace or drop license headers][rel:running-headroom] in your source code files with a single command. What's more, contrary to many similar tools, __Headroom__ allows you to also replace/drop headers that weren't previously generated by __Headroom__, using smart header auto-detection.
- __Powerful Customization__ - Default [configuration][rel:configuration] should cover most use-cases, but if you need to put empty lines before/after generated header, use different comment style of headers, you can customize the configuration to match exactly your needs.
- __Built-in OSS License Headers__ - If you want to use license header for one of the popular OSS licenses, then __Headroom__ can [generate them for you][rel:running-headroom#gen-command]: documentation/running-headroom.md - no need to search for them on web.
- __Automatic Initialization for OSS Projects__ - Setting up external tools like __Headroom__ for your project can be boring. Fortunately, __Headroom__ can [initialize itself][rel:running-headroom#init-command] for your project, by generating configuration file and template files.
- __Extended Functionality__ - __Headroom__ supports [extended functionality][rel:extended-functionality] for selected types of source code files, such as extracting extra data from processed source code files.
- __Copyright Year Updater__ - __Headroom__ is good not only for basic license header management, but also for further processing of generated headers. Do you need to [update years in your copyrights][rel:post-processing]? No problem!
